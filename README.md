# Tic-Tac-Toe


Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic, simple two-player paper-and-pencil game, also widely known as "Noughts and Crosses" in Commonwealth English or "Xs and Os" in other regions.
The game is played on a 3x3 grid (a square divided into nine smaller squares). Two players take turns placing their respective marks in an empty square: one player uses "X" and the other uses "O".
The objective of the game is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The game ends when:
 1) One player achieves three marks in a row and wins.
 2) All nine squares are filled, and neither player has achieved three in a row, resulting in a draw .
